Friday 3-1-19
South Island -Wanaka
Once again, we all thought that after having a long hike that the next day we would all sleep
in. But…NOPE! We were all up early. We went to work out at Snap. Jeff and I walked there
and back.
For the majority of the day we all took care of our “Back Home Responsibilities”. Yesterday we
had had such a big day. Tomorrow would also be a busy day. So we decided we would
hunker down and lay it low.
For dinner we all had leftovers. Since we would be leaving on Sunday. Each time we travel
to a new place we don’t wan t to haul anything more than we have to. We bought a cooler
bag that transports our refrigerator items. But, its rather small and space is a premium so we
really try to just have condiments that carry over with us.
That night we continued “Marvel Mania” by watching Iron Man 2. We went to bed early so
we would be fresh for tomorrows adventure.
