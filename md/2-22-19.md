**South - Island Wanaka**

We got up and headed to the gym to workout. This would be the last time we
would workout at “Pro Active” because the brand new Snap would be opening
on Monday. For the most part so far, we go to the gym 3-4 days a week and are
diligent to get between 12,000 -16,000 steps a day. It’s been such a treat to have
the time to get into better shape.

After working out, Jeff and I walked the 5 km into town to go to New World to
get something for dinner. Once we returned, I made “Elephant Fish” with
Risotto and steamed broccoli. It tasted very similar to “Opakapaka” from
Hawaii. It’s so flaky and tender, almost like eating a trick of butter. If you can
ever get your hands on it, try it out. Many people also call it Australian Ghost
Shark. It was fantastic!

After dinner, we played “Balderdash” a game about definitions. It was so much
fun to see Elijah and Ari come up with such clever answers. Jeff and I really got
a kick out of it!

Finally, we all got cozy with popcorn and watched the movie “Keeping up with
the Jones’. It was hilarious!
