**South Island - Invercargill**

We started the day with a trip to Snap to work out. After we finished Elijah
and Ari took the car home and Jeff and I walked back from there.
We followed Queens Drive south by way of Otepuni Gardens. The Otepuni
Gardens are various winding pathways along the banks of the Otepuni
Stream that provide a refreshing break from the city’s central business
district. It’s just a few minutes walk from the city center and encompasses
four city blocks. It gives a peaceful sanctuary to city workers, shoppers and
visitors.

Next, we headed through the Tweed Reserve, which offer space for venues
and recreation for a wide range of public use. The gardens are well kept
and space is ample. We enjoyed just watching people on a Saturday
afternoon in the park. It was lovely!

Finally, we passed the Rugby Park Stadium. GO ALL BLACK It was an
incredibly windy day. In fact, it was so windy that if I put both arms up I had
to fight it to step forward. Which was actually kind of fun!
Once we retuned I worked on my sell sheet and query letter for the book.
Elijah crammed to meet his deadline for AMPEL. Ari doubled up and did as
much as she could of Algebra II and Chemisty. Jeff worked on NMC/CUMC
details. After we finished we watched Myth Busters and headed to bed.
Tomorrow would be a busy day.
