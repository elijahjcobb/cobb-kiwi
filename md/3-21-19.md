Thursday – March 21st
North Island – Whitianga
Today was a day that we focused on “Back Home Responsibilities”. Ari and
Elijah went in to town early to work at a coffee shop. Jeff and I worked for most
of the day getting ahead of the necessary things, so that we’d have time later
for creative things.
In the late afternoon, I met the kids downtown to go to workout at the gym.
Jeff was still struggling with his throat, so he wasn’t up for it.
Later that evening, Jeff continued his BBQ lessons with Elijah. We had skewered
curry chicken for dinner.
After dinner, Jeff and I watched “The Last Samurai”. I mentioned earlier that the
majority of the filming was done here in New Zealand. In fact, we had just been
on the hillsides of the Uruti Valley, northern Taranaki, and on the west of the North
Island around 100 miles south of Auckland. The Japanese village was
constructed here, and Mount Taranaki doubled for ‘Mount Fuji‘. So we wanted
to be able to identify the locations. Plus, it’s just a great movie anyway (we’re
not big Tom Cruise fans, but everything else about the movie makes it 5 stars!
