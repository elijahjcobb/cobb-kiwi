**South Island - Wanaka**

I thought we would all be able to sleep well last night
considering all of the hiking and fresh air, but I was wrong. I’ll
tell you what though… we were all pretty sore. I think the
majority of the hurt occurred on the decent rather that the
ascent.

Today was the grand opening of Snap in Wanaka. So we
would be some of the first to try everything out. We figured
that the best thing to do is to stretch out the ache by putting
or muscles back to work, so we headed to Snap. It did
actually help! After the workout, Jeff and I decided that we
would walk back to the house since it was only about 3 miles
away.

We stopped by New World and picked up some food items.
When we got home, Jeff made BBQ chicken, and we tossed
it with linguini. We were all feeling pretty lazy that evening so
we just hung out and headed to bed early.
