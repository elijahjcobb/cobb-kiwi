January 23rd Wednesday
South Island – Manapouri
We woke up and headed into Te Anau to go to a local gym. It was a far cry from
Snap. It was housed in a warehouse with equipment that looked older than me.
But we still ended up with a good workout.
Once we returned to the house, Ari and I went on a walk through the reserve on
a trail called, “The Old Coach” road.
Later, Jeff and Elijah joined us down on the beach to watch the evening rush in.
It was relaxing to take in the stunning mountain vistas, because it was a full moon
the evening sky was bright and clear.
We returned to the house and Elijah made an interesting but delicious dinner of
Doritos pancakes and bacon. We played a fierce competition of Monopoly. Ari
won! This was the beginning of the kid’s new obsession “Monopoly Wars”.
