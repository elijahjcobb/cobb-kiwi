**North Island – Whitianga**

Today was our last day to be with George and Cheryl before they headed back
home, so we decided to just hang out and enjoy one another’s company. Elijah,
G & C, and I took a nice long walk on the beach. We all enjoyed listening to Ari
practice her Saxophone. She has been practicing everyday, so we know her
repertoire very well! Later in the afternoon, we all played Monopoly. Ari was the
big winner! For dinner, we had a Mexican feast!
