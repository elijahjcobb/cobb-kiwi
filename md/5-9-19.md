Thursday – May 9
North Island – Mairangi Bay

Botbar and Suey were leaving today, but their flight out of Auckland to LA was
not until the evening, so we had the whole day together. Since Jeff, the kids,
and I would be leaving tomorrow for Gisborne we figured we’d get a head start
on packing. Jeff made a huge batch of scrambled eggs and bacon.
Once we got ourselves all organized, we decided that since it was a beautiful
day we’d hit the beach for a bit. Jeff, Suey, and I ventured down the cliff to
catch some rays on the Campbell’s Bay side of the beach.
Being that it is late fall, we knew we wouldn’t break a sweat, but we still thought
we’d give it a chance. It wasn’t very warm… in fact it was more on the chilly
side, so we really didn’t last all that long. After about a half hour Suey gave up,
and about an hour in we called it a “good effort” and headed back upstairs.
We spent the rest of the day just hanging out and talking before we took them
to the airport. It was tough to say goodbye, but we’ll be home a month from
now, so that made it much easier.
Once we returned from the airport, we had “Every Man for Himself” dinner and
enjoyed a movie in the AV room. We really enjoyed having the awesome
massage lazy-boys and the big screen TV.
We called it an early night, since we had a drive big drive tomorrow. Not a lot to
report, other than the tire was fixed and we were ready for our next big
adventure.
