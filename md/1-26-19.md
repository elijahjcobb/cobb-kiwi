January 26th Saturday
South Island - Manapouri
We woke late and spent the day getting caught up on personal work. Jeff took a 4-mile jog
in the morning. Then continued to keep the ball rolling at CUMC and NMC stuff. Elijah worked
online for his job with AMPEL. Ari began her on-line classes through TCAPS (Chemistry &
Algebra II). I began on two online classes in order to get SCECHs towards certification renewal.
In the afternoon, Elijah and I took a small hike on the “Manipouri Trek Trailhead”. This is a hiking
trek that runs from Manipouri to Te Anau. It travels through the “bush” along the edge of the
lake and eventually out into the pasture land with the sheep. Oh, by the way… Everywhere
you turn there are sheep. The wool market is very prized here, and so are lamb chops!
That night we had beef enchiladas, and entered the third round of “Monopoly Wars”. I was
crowned the winner, YAY! Later we watch Jurassic World 1 and headed to bed to dream
about dinosaurs… (which I did all night).
