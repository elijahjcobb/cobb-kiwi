January 30th Wednesday
South Island - Invercargill
We got up and went to workout at Snap. After we finished, I decided to go on an
adventure of my own. So I walked back to the house which was about 7km or so. I was
walking along a path with high hedges that separated me from the road.
About half way through my journey I heard some rustling in the hedge. Slowly I peered
through the foliage to see 2 ostriches’ staring back at me. Obviously it startled me. Was
I seeing things? I had to check it out.
I followed the path until there was a wide enough space for me to get through. This time
I saw a mother and bay wallaby. No, I wasn’t going crazy… I had just entered a zoo
inside “Queen’s Park” It was awesome!
There were many varieties of exotic flowers and trees. Complete with a beautiful
Japanese garden. Just by chance, my exploration had brought me to another wonderful
discovery!
When I got home I made Chicken Cacciatore for dinner and we played another round
of Monopoly Mania in which Elijah finally won! Then we settled in with popcorn as we
watched Myth Busters.
