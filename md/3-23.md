**North Island – Whitianga**

Jeff and I got up and walked to town to workout. Ari, Jeff, and I spent
the afternoon working on stuff for our “Back home Responsibilities”.
Elijah and Madison arrived from Auckland. They went to their loft
apartment rental; (We call it “The Studio”. They unpacked, went to
New World to pick up some groceries, and then they met us back
home before dinner. We had BBQ chicken drumsticks with fresh green
beans. They left right after dinner. Jeff and I watched “Blazing
Saddles”. We headed to bed early because Jeff was still trying to get
over his throat infection.
