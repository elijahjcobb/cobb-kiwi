Jan 8 Tuesday
North Island - Stanmore Bay
We woke early to headed back into Auckland to go whale watching. This was a “must do” on our
NZ bucket list. We were at sea for a total of about 5 hours. We started our adventure from Viaduct
Harbor in downtown Central Auckland. The exploration occurred on a 65-foot marine research
vessel which supports Marine Wildlife studies through universities, trusts and government
departments.
Once on board the sailing crew became photographers so that they could track different marine
life and conduct biological studies during the tour. They were eager to share their knowledge with
us. The proceeds from their adventures contribute to the global effort to protect our planet’s
marine environment.
We were awed by the natural beauty of the Hauraki Gulf. We had breath-taking encounters with
the marine life. First, we saw a pod of over 200 short-beaked dolphins. They were playful and loved
jumping and diving into the boats wake.
Then, we saw 2 Bryde’s whales. They are usually about 50 ft. long and are a baleen whale, so they
do not have teeth. In Japan, early whalers called the Bryde’s the “iwashi” or anchovy, because
that is their primary diet source. It was incredible to see their gigantic bodies breach (almost as is
an acrobat) plunging high into the water and slapping back down sometimes twirling as they did
so. What a spectacular gift from nature!
