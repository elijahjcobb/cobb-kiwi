**North Island – Whitianga**

Jeff woke up with a terrible sore throat…Oh no! He went to the doctor
right away because it looked seriously bad. In the mean time, the kids
and I packed up all of our stuff, and cleaned in preparation for our
departure. George and Cheryl were heading back to Auckland to
return their rental car, and stay at a hotel close to the airport.
We will be staying in Whitianga for 2 more weeks. The house, is right
down the street from where we’ve been with George and Cheryl.

The doctor gave Jeff some antibiotics, and told him if he doesn’t feel
better in a week to come back. Once he returned, we loaded up the
“low-rider” and said our goodbyes. It was so wonderful to have them
come all this way to visit us.

We were able to check-in early, so we headed directly to the new
house. It’s quite small, but we’ll figure it out. Once we unloaded, we
to New World. Since Jeff was sick we didn’t really do anything
exciting. Everyone just kind of did their own thing and we headed to
bed early.
