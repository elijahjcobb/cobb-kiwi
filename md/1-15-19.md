**South Island - Christchurch**

Our first day in Christchurch we got up and Jeff and I went to Snap to workout.
In the afternoon we went on a long walk to the Christchurch Botanical Gardens. It featured native
and exotic plants and had a conservatory filled with ferns. We followed the Avon river around
through Hagley Park which is like a smaller version of central park. It contains a civic center, fields
for rugby, croquet, and cricket, and a free-swimming pool. We stumbled onto a huge patch of wild
rosemary. Again, growing to heights taller than me.
It was refreshing to see Kiwi’s out being active with their families. Just enjoying their day. We’ve
noticed that “Island Time” is in effect in NZ. Which means that time is only a general guide. You
don’t see people running around frantic trying to fit more into their day than they have time for.
(It’s also summer here – so that may have something to do with it!) They take their time and are
more intentional.

That night, we played Euchre with the kids on the back porch. The backyard was perfect; complete
with an herb garden and an apple tree. Ari made “Miso” soup for dinner, then we watched the
second episode of “Departures” that was set in NZ.
