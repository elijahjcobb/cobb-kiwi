February 6th Wednesday
South Island– Hawea
We spent the majority of the day working on our usual Back Home Responsibilities.
Later that evening, Jeff took a jog, and I went on a hike on my own. I walked down
to the edge of Lake Hawea, and followed the shoreline. There were massive boulders
along side of the waterline so I enjoyed jumping from one to the next. There was a
small cliff farther up that was fun to try to climb. Of course I ended up going around
it because I have very little upper body strength. Once I got to the top, there was a
solitary tree that I took a break under. The glacier water is such a beautiful
turquoise/electric blue. It was serene as the wind blew across the lake.
What a perfect hike! That night, Jeff made strawberry shortcake/shortbread…We
devoured it!
