**Dunedin**

We all slept in super late. It was awesome! Once we got up and
around we went to Snap to workout.

Jeff and I took a long walk down to St. Clair harbor, and then circled
back through the suburbs. It’s very interesting because there are no
“cookie-cutter” houses in any neighborhoods thus far. Each house
has its own unique style. Dunedin is known for its Scottish heritage, so
we felt right at home. The Victorian and Edwardian styles mixed with
ultra modern architecture make for an interesting blend. As we were
walking, we noticed an old rusted door that looked like it went into
the side of a mountain. It was hidden out of sight it just seemed to
pop out from behind a hedge and say “I am here”. We became very
curious… what could it be? A bomb shelter? A mining shaft? A secret
passage? Who knows?

Once we returned. Jeff met with another music administer. There is a
large student population here due to Otago University. All of the
people he has met with have been very accommodating and helpful
for his research. 

That evening we had a wonderful dinner that Ari prepared for us,
chicken with mashed potatoes. She is becoming an excellent chef,
and really enjoys having the kitchen to herself.
