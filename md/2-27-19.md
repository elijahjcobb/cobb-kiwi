**South Island – Wanaka**

We all got up and headed to Snap for a workout. After we were done,
Ari, Jeff, and I walked back home through the base of Mt. Iron. It was
a bit hot, but not as hot as the day we climbed it! They have so many
trails here for bikes, joggers, backpackers, and walkers. We enjoy
being in a house just outside of the city limit (it’s cheaper) but it allows
us the option of walking into town for little things instead of driving. That
way it forces us to get our steps in for the day.
This evening we had Mexican food and Watched Captain America.
Since we are all huge “Marvel” fans and we own every movie, we
thought we would re-watch each one in order of the storyline not
release time.

We’ll call it; “Marvel Mania” What goes best with
movies? Naturally…popcorn. As I write this blog each day, I see a
repeating pattern… POPCORN! It seems as though we have been
eating popcorn nearly every night. I’m sure that this new “Marvel
Mania” plan we’ve created will definitely include quite a bit of
popcorn in the coming days.
