South Island - Christchurch
Our second day in Christchurch, Jeff went to meet with the directors from two of different
universities. The kids and I went to Snap to workout. Just about the time we all thought the
“Instrument Conundrum” was over… Jeff decided that the keyboard that he had purchased
was not going to work for him. He gave it a try, but just felt that the smaller one lacked quality.
So he took a trek to the same music store as he had purchased it earlier at (a chain in a
different location). They fortunately gave him a store credit and he upgraded.
In the evening, we took another walk. We discovered “Peacock Fountain” and came upon
the rose garden at Mona Vale. It was so fragrant and tidy… every hedge pruned, and every
row neatly created an elaborate pattern one could see only from a bird’s eye view. It was
magnificent! Jeff barbecued Lamb and Ari made some lovely curried carrots for dinner.
