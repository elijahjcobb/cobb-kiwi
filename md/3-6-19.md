Wednesday - March 6th
South Island (Golden Bay) Collingwood
We got up and started the day by working on our “Back Home
Responsibilities”. Once we started to feel like our eyes were crossed we
decided to take a break and go for a walk on the beach. We followed
the tide again to the edge of where the water began. We walked the
rim of all of the sandbars crossing one to get to another. It was a ton of
fun! A beautiful rainbow appeared just as we returned.
After we returned, Jeff BBQ chicken, and we continued our “Marvel
Mania” by watching Thor 2.
