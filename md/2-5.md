Ari and I woke up and worked on writing while Ari continued her video work. I took a walk in
the morning. I went to visit the sheep up the road. There are tons of Sheep in NZ. Especially
in the South Island, they’re literally everywhere. I enjoy give them a little pet, they always seem
so content. Jeff and Elijah returned around 5:00 or so. Jeff really wanted to stretch his legs and
I’d been sitting on my computer all day so we headed out on a walk. We walked along
Lakeview Terrace and down to the end of Domain road. This time we didn’t get lost, but we
still made a great hike out of it.

When we returned I made pork chops and fresh green beans and we watched
A documentary called “The Infamous Underhand Throw” for cricket. Apparently, on February
1st 1981 when Australia played New Zealand for the International Cricket match. There was
one ball left remaining and in order for Australia to win they needed to ensure that New
Zealand did not get the runs they needed. So the Australian captain instructed the bowler
(his younger brother) to deliver the last ball underarm along the ground. His action was
considered legal at the time, but nevertheless it was a crooked and unethical move which
was not in the spirit of fair play. As a result, no one received the true glory of winning, and
instead it became known as “The 1981 Incident”. To this day… it’s still a big story!
