Jan 12. SaturdayNorth Island – Whangarei / Parua Bay
Okay… so here’s the deal… I didn’t put on enough sunscreen yesterday. This is quite amazing
considering the fact that I’m a sunscreen Nazi! Neither did Ari, so as a result we both were incredibly
burned by the intense rays down here. I suppose we were just too wrapped up with the Orca’s
that we didn’t reapply. Another tough lesson! I managed to slouch myself through a feeble
workout at the local gym but was experiencing a severe case of sun poisoning (complete with the
chills, nausea, and a whopper of a headache). As a result, Jeff and Elijah were the only ones able
to hike to the top of Mount Manaia. Most of the hike was sets of stairs – a total of 1,200 steps! It was
apparently an incredible view. Ari and I unfortunately spent the rest of the day inside. Drinking a
ton of water and ate toast.
