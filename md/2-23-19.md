February 23rd Saturday
South Island – Wanaka
Today was a quiet day. Jeff and I got up early so that he could work on a
composition, and I could get my sell-sheet and endorsement requests in.
In the afternoon, Jeff and I walked the 5 km into town to pick-up a few odds and
ends for dinner. It is so convenient for us to be about 3-4 km away from town,
because we get our steps in with the rounds trip being about 6-8 km. So, on the days
where we’re not going to the gym we are able to have a mission.
As evening rushed in, we sat on the deck overlooking the mountains and enjoyed
appetizers, wine, and the sunset. The mountain directly in front of us is called “Roy’s
Peak”. After spending a few nights staring at it, and wondering what it was like up
there, we decided that tomorrow would be the day!!!
Later, we watched the movie “Murder on the Orient Express”, and, of coarse, we had
popcorn. It seems like we’ve had popcorn almost every night since we arrived in
Wanaka. We just love it! Actually, it has high fiber, it’s a whole grain, it has some
protein, and is chocked- full of polyphenols (the same compounds that are found in
berries and tea that are linked to heart health and a lower cancer risks). So, there
you have it! Our attempt to justify our popcorn addiction has been authenticated.
