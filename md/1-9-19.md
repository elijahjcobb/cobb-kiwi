**North Island - Stanmore Bay**

Today was the day that the “Instrument Conundrum” had to be resolved. Tomorrow we would be
leaving Stanmore Bay and heading north. Jeff finally found a place where we could rent a Saxophone
for Ari. He also finally settled on a keyboard that would be small enough to fit in our station
wagon/minivan. Due to the fact that we will be relocating 22 times over the course of the next 5
months… space is an issue. We all have only 1 suitcase and 1 backpack each. By the time you add in
a keyboard, a saxophone, and grocery basics it’s pretty tight. You would be surprised how little space
that leaves for 4 people in a crammed car. He compromised quite a bit on quality, getting a small “home”
keyboard in fear that it wouldn’t fit. But, at least they would both have what they needed to keep up
musically.

By the time we finished cleaning the house to leave, Jeff returned, and we headed for our final farewell
back to Good Home Pub where both of the kids savored a good old-fashioned burger.
