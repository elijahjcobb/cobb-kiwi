Jan 13. Sunday
Last Day North Island / Wellington
We left Parua Bay in Whangarei and drove 10-hours to Wellington. It is the capitol city of NZ. We
spent one night at the Ibis hotel downtown. Here is the https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel3049-ibis-wellington/index.shtml#section-services. After we checked in, we went out to dinner at
“The Old Baily” a historical pub. Most of their dinner entrees were about 18-20 (NZ dollars) each.
The conversion rate from the New Zealand dollar to the American dollar is about .68 to 1.00. They
were offering a special that night, we could get any two meals for 25 NZ dollars. We just couldn’t
pass up the offer. We haven’t eaten out much and we were starving, so thought we’d splurge.
We wanted to taste as much of the Kiwi food as possible. Oh my…We ate like little piggy’s! But,
oh my… It was all delicious!
