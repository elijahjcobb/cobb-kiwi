**North Island - Stanmore Bay**

We woke early to return the courtesy car and pick-up our Honda Odyssey. We couldn’t believe it
when we got there… The car was wrapped up with a huge green bow and a sign that read:
“Congratulations! Dear Cobb’s Enjoy the Ride”. What an awesome personal touch!
When we returned, we took another hike down the beach. This time it was low tide, so all of the rocks
were exposed enough that we were able to shimmy around them to get to the ledge and climb up
onto the rocks that would have been islands when it’s high tide. We explored the little estuary pools
which now exposed created mini habitats each unique to its own. It was a great adventure! We
climbed and explored as much as we could before the tide returned. Mother nature is definitely
evident at every turn here.
