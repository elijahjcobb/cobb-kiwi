February 16th Saturday
South Island – Christchurch
This would be our last day in Christchurch. By a twist of fate, it was also
happened to be one of the cities summer festival called “Spark”. It’s
a concert in the middle of Hagley Park. It features the Christchurch
Symphony Orchestra, playing traditional classics as well as modern
day favorites. The evening ends with a firework spectacular.
When we arrived, admission was free but everything was roped off in
sections. The concert area was in the front of the stage, and further
back there were food and beverage trucks.
We feasted on a huge assortment of food; BBQ, Mexican, Chinese,
Indian, Vietnamese, Fried Chicken, more than our fair share of desserts.
The evening ended with a festive fireworks show.
Apparently, they had about 70,000 people attend. It reminded us of
Cherry Festival. We were surprised at how few law enforcements were
needed. Especially as it ended and all of the attendees were
scattering in all directions.
Once again… Our timing was spot on. We shared in the festivities and
went out with a bang! LOL!!!
