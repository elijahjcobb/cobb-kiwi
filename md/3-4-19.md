South Island – Collingwood
We arrived in Collinwood around 5 p.m. Collingwood is in the Heart of Golden
Bay at the western end of Highway 60. It’s a quiet little town, but there’s plenty
to do if you love the beach. The town is about the size of Empire, MI. The house
it literally 1 block from town and 10 steps to the beach. It has a beautiful large
back porch overlooking Golden Bay which eventually leads to the Tasman Sea.

Once we had unpacked and got ourselves settled in Jeff and I took a walk
around town. It’s kind of rich hippy kind of vibe. The beach is incredible! Sugar
sand, deep, and wide. A perfect place to explore or just listen to the waves. Our
host greeted us while she was bringing in her horses from a ride on the beach.
Here in NZ it’s okay to let your dogs run free pretty much everywhere even in
stores and restaurants, and horses are invited to parks and beaches. My sister
Mariah would love that!
Then, all of us took a walk out to the beach. It was low tide. The lowest tide I’ve
ever seen! We must have walked at least 3 football fields out before we could
put our toes in the water. We enjoyed finding shells and interestingly shaped
driftwood.
After our walk, we made taco’s for dinner. Then, we continued with our Marvel
Mania by watching Avengers 1
