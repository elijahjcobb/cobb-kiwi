View from top of Mt. Iron

February 18th Monday
South - Island Wanaka
Snap is opening a new location here in Wanaka. But, they will not
be open until next Monday. So, we did some research online to find
out what kind of alternate facilities would work for this week. We
found three different possibilities. So we hopped into the car and
went to see what some of these places were a good fit for us. After
driving around a bit we decided to go with “Pro Active”.
Once we worked out we headed home to have some lunch. There
is a mountain that is behind our home called “Mt. Iron”. It was a
pretty hot day, but we decided to give it a whirl. Mount Iron is a
glacier carved, rocky knoll that rises nearly 850 feet above the
surrounding countryside. This 5 km track begins right in our
neighborhood and climbs through low shrub land on Mount Iron's
western side to the summit. The trek up was way too hot! Ari and I
over heated. So, we had to take breaks whenever we could find a
few shrubs to duck in and cool ourselves down. Finally, we made it
to the top! Whew!
From the summit there were excellent 360-degree views. We could
even see; The Pisa range, Lake Wanaka and the Southern Alps.
After taking in the view, snapping some pictures, and cooling off a
bit, we followed the same trek to descend.
Later, Jeff BBQ chicken and Ari made a Cobb salad. We watched
more “Kruzgesagt” science videos, and of course ate more
popcorn.
