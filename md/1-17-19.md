January 17th Thursday
South Island - Christchurch
It was our last day in Christchurch so we took it easy knowing that the following day we had a
4-hour car drive ahead of us. We all went to Snap for a tough workout. I had my hair foiled
at a salon. It was a very interesting experience. They brought me a beautiful treat while my
hair was processing. It was a plate with a teapot sitting inside of a tea cup and two biscuits
(cookies) and two chocolate kisses. It felt very fancy.
That night we had appetizers for dinner and Ari made a lovely stir-fry of broccoli with peppers
and normal bacon. Since most of the refrigerators are very small here, we usually go shopping
almost every day if not every other. We only buy what we know we’ll eat right away, also
because we’re on the move about every 5-7 days.
The car has been working out pretty well. But, because it’s pretty small and is stuffed tight,
the new keyboard barely fits. It rests between Elijah and Ari heads, but he and Elijah managed
to get it all in there. Since we have ALL of our stuff jammed in there, we ride pretty close to the
pavement as we’re going down the road. We decided to nickname the car the “Low-rider”.
